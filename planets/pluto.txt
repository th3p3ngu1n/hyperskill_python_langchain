Pluto
A dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune.
It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered.
After it was discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun.
Beginning in the late 20th century, many objects similar to Pluto were discovered in the outer solar system, and in 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined Pluto as a "dwarf planet," which is a new category of solar system objects. In the new classification, Pluto was assigned the number 134340.
Pluto is the largest and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun.
